- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjust thresholds, model sizes, and other parameters
- **Class Filtering**: Focus on specific object types (e.g., people, vehicles)
- **Performance Metrics**: Compare algorithm performance in the analysis dashboard

### Intelligent Alert System

The system includes an intelligent alert system with multiple algorithms for detecting various suspicious activities:

#### Loitering Detection Algorithms
- **Time Threshold**: Simple approach that triggers an alert when a person stays in the same area for a certain amount of time
- **Trajectory Heatmap**: Uses heatmaps to track movement patterns over time and identify areas where people spend significant time
- **LSTM Prediction**: Uses deep learning to predict suspicious movement patterns and detect more complex loitering behaviors

#### Crowd Detection Algorithms
- **Count Threshold**: Simple approach that triggers an alert when the number of people exceeds a threshold
- **Density Map**: Uses density maps to estimate crowd size and distribution, can detect crowded areas even with partial occlusion
- **Clustering**: Uses DBSCAN clustering to group people into crowds and detect multiple crowd formations in different areas

#### Other Alert Types
- **Motion Detection**: Identify significant movement in the scene
- **Object Counting**: Count the number of objects of a specific type
- **Boundary Crossing**: Detect when objects cross defined boundaries

#### Alert Processing
When an alert is triggered, the system:
1. Captures an image of the scene
2. Saves metadata about the alert (timestamp, type, confidence, algorithm used)
3. Sends notifications via configured channels (email, SMS)
4. Displays the alert in the dashboard
5. Records metrics for algorithm performance analysis

### Web Dashboards

The system includes two web-based dashboards for monitoring, analysis, and configuration:

#### Main Dashboard
- **Live Camera Feeds**: View all camera streams in real-time
- **Detection Overlays**: See object detections with bounding boxes and labels
- **Alert History**: Browse past alerts with images and details
- **System Status**: Monitor system performance and resource usage
- **Configuration**: Change system settings through the UI

- **Historical Data**: Analyze performance trends over time
- **Visualization Tools**: Interactive charts and graphs for data analysis
- **Export Functionality**: Export metrics data for further analysis

### Modular and Extensible Design

The system is designed to be easily extended and customized:

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Each module can be modified independently
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined interfaces between components
- **Configuration-Driven**: Most functionality can be adjusted through configuration
- **Plugin System**: Add new camera types, detection models, or alert rules

## How the System Works

### Startup Process

1. The system loads the configuration from `config.yaml`
2. It initializes the logger and sets up error handling
3. The stream manager connects to configured cameras or falls back to video files
4. The detection model is loaded (using GPU if available)
5. The alert system is initialized with configured rules
6. The dashboard web server starts
7. The main processing loop begins

### Main Processing Loop

1. The system reads frames from all configured cameras
2. Each frame is preprocessed using the selected algorithm (optical flow, feature-based, or deep learning stabilization)
3. The selected detection algorithm (YOLOv5, YOLOv8, SSD, or Faster R-CNN) processes the frame to identify objects
4. The tracking algorithm (SORT, DeepSORT, IoU, or Optical Flow) associates detections across frames
5. The alert system uses various algorithms to analyze the tracked objects:
   - Loitering detection algorithms (time threshold, trajectory heatmap, or LSTM prediction)
   - Crowd detection algorithms (count threshold, density map, or clustering)
   - Other alert types (motion detection, object counting, boundary crossing)
6. If an alert is triggered, notifications are sent and the alert is logged
7. Performance metrics are collected for all algorithms and sent to the analysis dashboard
8. The processed frame with detection overlays is sent to the main dashboard
9. The loop continues until the system is stopped

### Alert Generation

1. The decision maker receives detection and tracking results for each frame
2. It applies various algorithms to analyze the tracked objects:
   - **Loitering Detection**:
     - Time threshold algorithm tracks objects and measures their dwell time
     - Trajectory heatmap algorithm builds heatmaps of object positions over time
     - LSTM prediction algorithm learns normal movement patterns and detects anomalies
   - **Crowd Detection**:
     - Count threshold algorithm counts objects in proximity
     - Density map algorithm estimates crowd density using deep learning
     - Clustering algorithm groups objects using DBSCAN and analyzes cluster properties
   - **Other Alerts**:
     - Motion detection algorithm analyzes frame differences
     - Object counting algorithm tracks objects entering/leaving areas
     - Boundary crossing algorithm detects objects crossing virtual lines
3. When an algorithm's threshold is exceeded, an alert is generated
4. The alert includes:
   - Timestamp
   - Alert type (loitering, crowd, etc.)
   - Algorithm used
   - Confidence score
   - Image of the scene with visual overlays
   - JSON metadata with detailed information
   - Performance metrics for the algorithm
5. The notifier sends the alert via configured channels (email, SMS)
6. The alert is displayed in the dashboard and logged for future reference
7. Alert metrics are sent to the analysis dashboard for performance evaluation
