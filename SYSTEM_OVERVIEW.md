## Key Features

### Multi-Camera Support

The system can monitor multiple camera streams simultaneously, including:

- **IP Cameras**: Connect to network cameras using RTSP or HTTP protocols
- **Webcams**: Use locally connected USB cameras
- **Video Files**: Analyze pre-recorded video files for testing or forensic analysis

The system automatically detects and uses video files from the `vigilance_system/videos` directory if no cameras are configured, making it easy to test and demonstrate the system without requiring actual cameras.

### Real-time Object Detection

The system uses YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for object detection, to identify objects in video frames. Key features include:

- **Multiple Model Options**: Choose from different YOLOv5 variants (s, m, l, x) based on your performance requirements
- **GPU Acceleration**: Utilize CUDA-enabled GPUs for faster processing
- **Configurable Confidence Threshold**: Adjust the detection sensitivity
- **Class Filtering**: Focus on specific object types (e.g., people, vehicles)

### Intelligent Alert System

The system includes an intelligent alert system that can detect various suspicious activities:

- **Loitering Detection**: Alert when a person remains in an area for too long
- **Crowd Monitoring**: Detect when too many people gather in an area
- **Motion Detection**: Identify significant movement in the scene
- **Object Counting**: Count the number of objects of a specific type

When an alert is triggered, the system:
1. Captures an image of the scene
2. Saves metadata about the alert (timestamp, type, confidence)
3. Sends notifications via configured channels (email, SMS)
4. Displays the alert in the dashboard

### Web Dashboard

The system includes a web-based dashboard for monitoring and configuration:

- **Live Camera Feeds**: View all camera streams in real-time
- **Detection Overlays**: See object detections with bounding boxes and labels
- **Alert History**: Browse past alerts with images and details
- **System Status**: Monitor system performance and resource usage
- **Configuration**: Change system settings through the UI
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose from different detection, tracking, classification, and analysis algorithms
- **Algorithm Visualization**: See how each algorithm works with educational visualizations
- **Decision Making Visualization**: Visual representation of how decisions are made
- **Network Configuration**: Adjust frame rate, resolution, and routing algorithms
- **View Modes**: Switch between grid view and single camera view

### Modular and Extensible Design

The system is designed to be easily extended and customized:

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Each module can be modified independently
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined interfaces between components
- **Configuration-Driven**: Most functionality can be adjusted through configuration
- **Plugin System**: Add new camera types, detection models, or alert rules

## How the System Works

### Startup Process

1. The system loads the configuration from `config.yaml`
2. It initializes the logger and sets up error handling
3. The stream manager connects to configured cameras or falls back to video files
4. The detection model is loaded (using GPU if available)
5. The alert system is initialized with configured rules
6. The dashboard web server starts
7. The main processing loop begins

### Main Processing Loop

1. The system reads frames from all configured cameras
2. Each frame is preprocessed (denoising, stabilization)
3. The detection model processes the frame to identify objects
4. The tracking algorithm associates detections across frames
5. The classification algorithm categorizes detected objects
6. The analysis algorithm evaluates the situation based on tracking and classification
7. The decision maker determines if an alert should be triggered
8. If an alert is triggered, notifications are sent and the alert is logged
9. The algorithm visualization is added to the processed frame
10. The decision making visualization is added to the processed frame
11. The network routing simulation is applied
12. The processed frame with all visualizations is sent to the dashboard
13. The loop continues until the system is stopped

### Alert Generation

1. The decision maker receives detection, tracking, and classification results for each frame
2. It applies various rules to the data:
   - Tracks objects across frames to detect loitering
   - Counts objects to detect crowds
   - Analyzes motion patterns
   - Evaluates classification confidence
3. The selected analysis algorithm (Basic, Weighted, or Fuzzy) processes the data
4. When a rule threshold is exceeded, an alert is generated
5. The alert includes:
   - Timestamp
   - Alert type (loitering, crowd, etc.)
   - Confidence score
   - Classification details
   - Tracking history
   - Analysis results
   - Image of the scene
   - JSON metadata
6. The notifier sends the alert via configured channels
7. The alert is displayed in the dashboard with visualization of the decision process
